TODO:
  - High:
    * find a (proper) way to get insitive case matching with fixed strings
    * implement recursive option (and exclude options: exclude, exclude-dir, include)
    * implement -w option
    * improve error handling (fd) and clean up msg or relative

  - Normal:
    * write a man page

  - Low:
    * garbage slist_element_t and its data

  - Other:
    * [HIGH] rewrite Windows specfic pieces to have a Windows build (both: statically and dynamically linked to ICU libraries)
    * [HIGH] create distro package source (Debian) / port (*BSD)?
    * [CHECK] mmap already used internaly by icu?
    * fixed string u_str* => u_mem*?

Ideas :
  - write ucat, a cat replacement ?

Known bugs:
  - ICU is unable to guess default codepage when it doesn't appear in LANG environment variable
    eg: with LANG=fr_FR, codepage becomes UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1. So explicit it (LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1 in this case).
