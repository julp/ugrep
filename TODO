TODO:
  - High:
    * find a (proper) way to get insitive case matching with fixed strings (+ 0.1)
    * implement recursive option (and exclude options) (+ 0.1)
    * implement -q and -s options
    * implement -w option

  - Normal:
    * write a man page

  - Low:
    * find/write a convenient way to have custom highlight colours

  - Other:
    * [HIGH] rewrite Windows specfic pieces to have a Windows build (both: statically and dynamically linked to ICU libraries)
    * [HIGH] create distro package source (Debian) / port (*BSD)?
    * [CHECK] mmap already used internaly by icu?
    * fixed string u_str* => u_mem*?

Notes:
  - fixed string > word match : look UChars before (^ or !is_alpha([c-1])?) and after ($ or !is_alpha([c-1])?)

Ideas :
  - write ucat, a cat replacement ?

Known bugs:
  - ICU is unable to guess default codepage when it doesn't appear in LANG environment variable
    eg: with LANG=fr_FR, codepage becomes UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1. So explicit it (LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1 in this case).
