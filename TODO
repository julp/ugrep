TODO :

* mmap already used internaly by icu?

* add eof callback to reader_t

* implement recursive option (-r) with FTS

* fixed string > word match : look UChars before (^ or !is_alpha([c-1])?) and after ($ or !is_alpha([c-1])?)

* handle stdin (not seekable)

* write ucat, a cat replacement ?

* implement a smart colorizer for all matches (based on ranges?)



Known bugs :

* ICU is unable to guess default codepage when it doesn't appear in LANG environment variable
  eg: with LANG=fr_FR, codepage becomes UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1. So explicit it (LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1 in this case).
