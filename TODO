TODO:
  - High:
    * find a (proper) way to get insitive case matching with fixed strings
    * implement recursive option (and exclude options: exclude, exclude-dir, include)
    * implement -w option
    * extend error handling (fd) and clean up msg or relative
    * implement context options (-A, -B, -C, -\d+)

    * improve binary file handling (--binary-files=text|binary not implemented and display)
    * lflag: stop at first match
    * cFlag, lflag, LFlag cancel --binary-files (except vFlag)
    * cFlag actually seems broken with binary files (because encoding? /bin/cp is UTF-32LE detected)

  - Normal:
    * write a man page

  - Low:
    * extend new line to form feed (0x0c), carriage return (0x0d), next line (0x85), line separator (0x2028), paragraph separator (0x2029) ?

  - Other:
    * [HIGH] rewrite Windows specfic pieces to have a Windows build (both: statically and dynamically linked to ICU libraries)
    * [HIGH] create distro package source (Debian) / port (*BSD)?
    * [CHECK] mmap already used internaly by icu?
    * fixed string u_str* => u_mem*?

Ideas:
  - write ucat, a cat replacement ?

Known bugs:
  - ICU is unable to guess default codepage when it doesn't appear in LANG environment variable
    eg: with LANG=fr_FR, codepage becomes UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1. So explicit it (LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1 in this case).

  - bzlib read 0 byte of an uncompressed/normal file (so no error, file skipped)
